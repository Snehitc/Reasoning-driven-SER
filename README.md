# Reasoning-driven-SER
Official Implementation of "Reasoning Driven Captions To Assist Noise Robust Speech Emotion Recognition"

# ðŸš§ Under construction ðŸš§
This repository is under construction. The necessary code files and a link to the trained model's checkpoint will be updated here soon.


# Example with noisy speech (-10dB): Mellow vs Transcript
| Emotion     | Happy   | Surprise |
| :-------:   | :------   | :-------   |
| Speech      | MSP-PODCAST_2198_0087.wav | MSP-PODCAST_2055_0589.wav | 
| Noise       | Sea    |  Garden |
| Transcript  | *... designation, money over ip-*  | *we have new pint glasses made. we drink a fair amount of be-*  |
| Mellow      | *The audio is a dynamic and immersive experience, with the sound of the waves crashing against the shore creating a sense of tension and release. the man's voice adds a sense of human presence and narrative to the audio, making it feel more engaging and engaging.*   | *'The audio is loud and continuous, with a high level of energy and intensity. it is likely that the audio is intended to be attention-grabbing or to convey a sense of urgency or importance.*  |
